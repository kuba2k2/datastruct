# py-datastruct

This is a (relatively) simple, **pure-Python, no dependency** library, aiming to simplify parsing and building binary data structures. It uses **[`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)** as its main container type, and **[`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)-compatible format specifiers** for writing field definitions.

The way of composing structures is somewhat similar to (and inspired by) [Construct](https://github.com/construct/construct). While probably not as powerful, it should give more flexibility and control over the data, as well as **full IDE type hinting**.

## Installation

```shell
pip install py-datastruct
```

## Usage

This simple example illustrates creating a 24-byte long structure, consisting of a 32-bit integer, an 8-byte 0xFF-filled padding, and a 12-byte `bytes` string.

```python
from hexdump import hexdump
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datastruct import DataStruct
from datastruct.fields import field, padding

@dataclass
class MyStruct(DataStruct):
    my_number: int = field("I", default=123)
    _1: ... = padding(8)
    my_binary: bytes = field("12s")

my_object = MyStruct(my_binary=b"Hello Python")
print(my_object)
# MyStruct(my_number=123, my_binary=b'Hello World!')

my_object = MyStruct(my_number=5, my_binary=b"Hello World!")
print(my_object)
# MyStruct(my_number=5, my_binary=b'Hello World!')

packed = my_object.pack()
hexdump(packed)
# 00000000: 05 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF 48 65 6C 6C  ............Hell
# 00000010: 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21                           o World!

unpacked = MyStruct.unpack(packed)
print(unpacked)
# MyStruct(my_number=5, my_binary=b'Hello World!')
print(my_object == unpacked)
# True
```

You might also pass a stream (file/BytesIO/etc.) to `pack()` and `unpack()`. Otherwise, `pack()` will create a BytesIO stream and return its contents after packing; `unpack()` will accept a `bytes` object as its parameter.

`pack()` and `unpack()` also accept custom, keyword-only arguments, that are available in the Context, throughout the entire operation.

### Context

Upon starting a pack/unpack operation, a `Context` object is created. The context is a container scoped to the currently processed structure. It's composed of the following main elements:

- all values of the current structure - when packing; during unpacking, it contains all values of fields that were already processes (the context "grows")
- all keyword arguments passed to `pack()`/`unpack()` (for the root context only)
- all keyword arguments passed to `subfield()` (for child contexts only)
- `_: Context` - reference to the parent object's context (only when nesting `DataStruct`s)
- `self: Any` - the current datastruct - note that it's a `DataStruct` subclass when packing, and a `Container` when unpacking
- `G` - global context - general-purpose container that is not scoped to the current structure (it's identical for nested structs)
  - `io: IO[bytes]` - the stream being read from/written to
  - `packing: bool` - whether current operation is packing
  - `unpacking: bool` - whether current operation is unpacking
  - `root: Context` - context of the topmost structure
  - `tell: () -> int` - function returning the current position in the stream
  - `seek: (offset: int, whence: int) -> int` - function allowing to seek to an absolute offset
- `P` - local context - general-purpose container that is different for each nested struct
  - `config: Config` - current DataStruct's config 
  - `tell: () -> int` - function returning the current position in the current structure (in bytes)
  - `seek: (offset: int, whence: int) -> int` - function allowing to seek to an offset within the current structure
  - `skip: (length: int) -> int` - function allowing to skip `length` bytes
  - `i: int` - (for `repeat()` fields only) index of the current item of the list
  - `item: Any` - (for `repeat()` fields, in `last=` lambda only) item processed right before evaluation
  - `self: Any` - (packing only) value of the current field

The context is "general-purpose", meaning that the user can write custom values to it. All fields presented above can be accessed by lambda functions - see "Parameter evaluation".

### Parameter evaluation

Most field parameters support pack/unpack-time evaluation (which means they can e.g. depend on previously read fields). Lambda expressions are then given the current context, and expected to return a simple value, that would be statically valid in this parameter.

```python
an_unpredictable_field: int = field(lambda ctx: "I" if randint(1, 10) % 2 == 0 else "H")
```

### Ellipsis - special value

A special value of type `Ellipsis`/`...` is used in the library, to indicate something not having a type or a value. **It's not the same as `None`**. `built()` fields, for example, have `...` as value after creating the struct, but before packing it for the first time.

Special fields (like `padding()`, which don't have any value) must have `...` as their type hint.

### Variable-length fields

This is a simple example of using parameter evaluation to dynamically size a `bytes` string. Binary strings use the `<len>s` specifier, which can be omitted (simple `int` can be used instead). 

```python
@dataclass
class MyStruct(DataStruct):
    data_length: int = field("I")
    data: bytes = field(lambda ctx: ctx.data_length)
```

The user is still responsible for adjusting `data_length` after changing `data`. The `built()` field comes in handy here:

```python
@dataclass
class MyStruct(DataStruct):
    data_length: int = built("I", lambda ctx: len(ctx.data))
    data: bytes = field(lambda ctx: ctx.data_length)
```

When unpacking, the `data_length` field will be used to dynamically size the `data` field. When packing, `data_length` will always be recalculated based on what's in `data`.

### Wrapper fields - storing a list

Lists are also iterables, like `bytes`, but they store a number of items of a specific type. Thus, the `repeat()` field **wrapper** has to be used. 

**Wrapper fields** simply require calling them first with any used parameters, then with the "base" field.

```python
@dataclass
class MyStruct(DataStruct):
    item_count: int = built("H", lambda ctx: len(ctx.items))
    # This creates a list of 16-bit integers.
    # The list is empty by default.
    items: List[int] = repeat(lambda ctx: ctx.item_count)(field("H"))

my_object = MyStruct()
my_object.items = [0x5555, 0x4444, 0x3333, 0x2222]
my_object.item_count = 1  # this doesn't matter, as the field is rebuilt
packed = my_object.pack()
hexdump(packed)
# 00000000: 04 00 55 55 44 44 33 33  22 22
```

### Conditional fields

They're also wrapper fields - if the condition is not met, they act like as if the field didn't exist at all.

```python
@dataclass
class MyStruct(DataStruct):
    has_text: bool = field("?")
    text: str = cond(lambda ctx: ctx.has_text)(field("8s", default=""))

my_object = MyStruct.unpack(b"\x01HELOWRLD")
print(my_object)
# MyStruct(has_text=True, text='HELOWRLD')

my_object = MyStruct.unpack(b"\x00")
print(my_object)
# MyStruct(has_text=False, text='')
```

### Switch fields

Switch fields are like more powerful conditional fields. The following example reads an 8/16/32-bit number, depending on the prefixing length byte. If the length is not supported, it reads the value as `bytes` instead.

```python
number_length: int = field("B", default=1)
number: Union[int, bytes] = switch(lambda ctx: ctx.number_length)(
    _1=(int, field("B")),
    _2=(int, field("H")),
    _4=(int, field("I")),
    default=(bytes, field(lambda ctx: ctx.number_length)),
)
```

The values on the left (`_1`, `_2`, `_4`) are the **keys**. The key is picked depending on the key-lambda result (`ctx.number_length`). The value on the right is a tuple of the expected field type, and a `field()` specifier.

Since it's not possible to pass just `1` as a keyword argument, integers are looked up prefixed with an underscore as well. Enums are additionally looked up by their name and value, and booleans are looked up by **lowercase** `true`/`false`.

Note that you can pass (probably) any kind of field to the switch list.
